## About the project

Project Elara is a mission to create a just world and equitable world where everyone can live a quality life, created through the hard work of many generations.

## Who we are

We are a **nonprofit organization for engineering and research** that strives to make the world better. We dedicate ourselves to undertaking the scientific advancements to build the better world we envision, and to release our work and technology as **open-source and for absolutely no cost**.

[Read our founding document, the Elara Charter](@/charter.md).

## Our vision

We believe in the spirit of collaboration and opennessâ€”that in working together, we will be able to accomplish far greater things than we could ourselves. And we want to pass our mission down to future generations, so that even if we can't finish something in our lifetimes, it will be finished one day.

## Our research areas

It includes research initiatives to build faster-than-light spaceships, black hole reactors, perform climate change mitigation, and develop technologies that will create a future we can only dream of today. But it is not limited to research. We welcome anyone who wants to build a better future with us, and through sharing resources, helping each other, and building an inclusive, welcoming community, we will make that future a reality.
