## About the project

**Project Elara** (meaning<span id="footnote-name-ref"></span><sup><a href="#footnote-name">1</a></sup> _"hope"_) is a grassroots organization dedicated to space-based energy technologies. We are scientists and engineers dedicated to open-sourcing science, and we believe that space-based energy technologies, done right, can usher in a peaceful, hopeful future.

## Our vision

On Earth, we are depleting the Earth's natural resources every moment to power our civilization, resources that will be exhausted one day. **Space-based power constellations** that harvest solar energy and bring it back to Earth have the potential to transform the world by providing a source of near-unlimited energy to **power the world for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years**.

Space power constellation technology also has many secondary uses. These include precision interferometry for probing gravitational waves, improved laser surgery and directed cancer tumor treatment, and **most importantly**, providing power and internet in remote and underdeveloped regions for emergency, humanitarian, and rescue operations.

We are not (yet) near building a functioning space power constellation, but we are passionate about this technology and want to be part of making it possible!
