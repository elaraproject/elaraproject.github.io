## About the project

**Project Elara** is a mission to create a just world and equitable world where everyone can live a quality life, created through the hard work of many generations.

## Who we are

We are a **nonprofit organization for engineering and research** that strives to make the world better. We dedicate ourselves to undertaking the advancements in science and engineering to build the better world we envision, and to release our work and technology as **open-source and for absolutely no cost**.

[Read our founding document, the Elara Charter](@/charter.md).

## Our vision

We believe in the spirit of collaboration and opennessâ€”that in working together, we will be able to accomplish far greater things than we could ourselves. And we want to pass our mission down to future generations, so that even if we can't finish something in our lifetimes, it will be finished one day.

## Our research areas

Our current research focus is in the domain of **space power swarm technology**. Space power swarms have the potential to transform the world by providing a source of unlimited and perpetual energy, for all practical purposes. Research in this field is in its infancy, and a functioning space swarm is likely to take centuries to be realized, which is why we recognize this will be a multi-generational and international effort.

However, the associated research has numerous other, more immediate uses. These include precision interferometry for probing gravitational waves, improved laser surgery and directed cancer tumor treatment, and providing power and internet in remote regions for emergency, humanitarian, and rescue operations.
