## About the project

**Project Elara** (meaning<span id="footnote-name-ref"></span><sup><a href="#footnote-name">1</a></sup> _"hope"_) is a mission to **safeguard future generations** with the guarantee of a just and equitable world where everyone can live a quality life. It is a mission that will take the hard work of many generations and the contributions of countless people; but it is one we are dedicated to strive for.

_The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate..._

_...[this knowledge should] underscore our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known._ 

\- Carl Sagan, *[A Pale Blue Dot](https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot)*

## Who we are

We are a **nonprofit organization for engineering and research** that strives to make the world better. We dedicate ourselves to undertaking the advancements in science and engineering to build the better world we envision, and to release our work and technology as **open-source and for absolutely no cost**.

[Read our founding document, the Elara Charter](@/charter.md).

## Our vision

We believe in the spirit of collaboration and opennessâ€”that in working together, we could be able to accomplish far greater things than we could ourselves. And we want to pass our mission down to future generations, so that even if we can't finish something in our lifetimes, it can be finished one day.

## Our research areas

While we intend to pursue additional areas of research with time, our current research focus is in the domain of **space power swarm technology**. Space power swarms have the potential to transform the world by providing a source of near-unlimited and long-lasting energy, for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years. Research in this field is still in its infancy, and a functioning space swarm is likely to take centuries to be realized, which is why we recognize this will be a multi-generational and international effort.

Our research does not simply target our primary goal of powering the world; it has numerous other, more immediate uses. These include precision interferometry for probing gravitational waves, improved laser surgery and directed cancer tumor treatment, and **most importantly**, providing power and internet in remote and underdeveloped regions for emergency, humanitarian, and rescue operations. It is our hope that our research may be able to change lives one day.
