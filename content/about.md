# About

Project Elara aims to combine the efforts of scientists, engineers, entrepeneurs, developers, and artists to together improve the world through open-source research. Through open science and open knowledge, it aims to pass down its knowledge and its spirit of collaboration to solve the world's issues through generations of combined effort. Our research encompasses many areas and technologies that we work to give freely to everyone, and make sure that it always belongs to everyone.

Please read our [Charter](@/charter.md) for a comprehensive description of the Project.
