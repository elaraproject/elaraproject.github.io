# About

Project Elara aims to combine the efforts of scientists, engineers, entrepeneurs, developers, and artists to together work towards space-based energy technologies that could one day power the world. Through open science and open knowledge, it aims to freely share its knowledge and spread its spirit of collaboration. We strive to ensure as much of our work as possible is given freely away (or at minimal cost) for everyone's benefit.

The Project name, _elara_, is a constructed word that means "hope". Specifically, it is hope for something that is not impossible, just very hard. But for something that has at least a possibility of it becoming real one day, with sacrifice, dedication, and continuous work.

Please read our [Charter](@/charter.md) for a comprehensive description of the Project.
