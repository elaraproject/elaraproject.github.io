# The Provisional Charter of Project Elara

The members of Project Elara, dedicated to the mission of advancing peaceful space-based energy, institute this Charter among ourselves, to guide us in our pursuit of this mission, until such a time comes when it may come into force.

1.1 All members of Project Elara (henceforth referred to simply as "the community") are free, equal, and have inviolable dignity. They have the responsibility to treat each other as equals and to act with conscience towards one another. There shall be no disparity in the treatment of any member in the community on any grounds. Any attempts to discriminate against any member of the community on the basis of identity, show favoritism, or deny equal protection under the Charter is unacceptable and will be subject to consequences. This article is **not to be removed, amended, or abridged for any reason**, and cannot be changed by a consensus or majority decision.

1.2 Members have the freedom to hold and express their opinions, or to openly express a disagreement with another's opinions, in a **respectful** manner. They also have the freedom to criticize, in public or in private, and to do so without retaliation, when this is done in **good faith**.

1.3 Members are to be treated with fairness and are guaranteed protection from harassment, intimidation, abuse, and assaults on themselves and their well-being. Every member of the community has an obligation to come to the defense of another when a member has been subject to such attacks, and to render reasonable support and solidarity. To fail to do so is subject to immediate review of wrongdoing and possible repercussions.

1.4 If a member has been suspected of wrongdoing, the member will be temporarily **stripped of their position** and **placed in quarantine** from the rest of the community. An open board of review will be established to examine the wrongdoing. A member cannot be subject to arbitrary accusations or baseless attacks on their honor and reputation, that attempts to circumvent this review process, or exact retribution. If a member is found _responsible_ of wrongdoing, the quarantine may be **extended indefinitely** while the member's behavior is monitored and continuously reviewed. In the most serious of cases, the member may be permanently and irrevocably expelled.

1.5 Any board of review that does not abide by the standards and procedure set out in the Charter, or is found to be biased, corrupt, or inept, will result in the accused member absolved and an immediate review of the accuser and board of review. If found of complicity or miscarriage of due process, all members involved will be immediately stripped of their positions. In addition, any member of the community may request a re-review on the behalf of another, should they disagree with the outcome of a review of wrongdoing. If such a re-review finds that the accused member did not commit the wrongdoing in question, the accused member will be absolved.

1.6 The Charter takes precedence over all acts and decisions made in the Project, and may not be violated for **any** reason. If any member of the Project suspects a violation of the Charter, a report and investigation is to be started immediately, and a remedy to the violation promptly issued. As a last resort, members of the Project have an obligation to resist violation of the Charter and restore its provisions by any methods necessary.

1.7 Membership may be acquired by taking a pledge to protect, defend, and abide by the Charter, in the individual's own words, in oral or written form. This must be followed by a public statement to the same within a reasonable timeframe. After attaining membership, the individual is granted an official role within the Project. Full members are bound to their pledge and have full responsibility for their actions.

1.8 Non-members of the Project may work alongside the Project and receive **participant status**, without being required to join the Project, unless a consensus in the Project decides against their admittance on fair grounds. Non-members must be treated with respect within the Project and receive rightful credit for their work. Non-members, however, do not have the same obligations as members do, and may choose to leave the Project at any time.

1.9 Positions of leadership within the Project are given only to volunteers who have taken the pledge to the Charter. Before attaining a position of leadership, volunteers must spend a period of no less than five years carrying out duties delegated to them by the incumbent leadership and by the community at large. A member may serve for a maximum of ten years in a leadership role, and **may not serve again**.

1.10 The Project may never be dissolved. Any attempt to rescind the Charter, dismantle the Project, or take away its independence will be treated as an attack on the Project, and all members of the Project are obligated to oppose any such action.

1.11 The enactment of this Charter is sufficient by a community consensus. From that point on, it will be considered in full force.

1.12 We declare upon ratification that the Charter binds us in perpetuity and take it upon ourselves to realize it to the fullest measure.
