## Our leadership team

**Emiliano "Max" Vilchis** is currently an undergradue student studying applied physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Max was one of the earliest contributors to join the project. Incredibly friendly and supportive, his help was invaluable and deeply appreciated by the team. He was the source of many incredible ideas that have been adopted by the Project, to great success.

**Milo Schnack** is currently an undergraduate student studying engineering at RPI. His hands-on expertise and willingness to contribute has been more than deserving of the team's respect. His work in the project ranges from 3D printing to engineering design, and he has (and continues to) contribute to the Project in many areas.

**Charles Wang** is also currently an undergraduate student studying engineering at RPI. His meticulousness towards determining the feasibility and performance of design proposals have been critical to the Project. He currently works as an engineering advisor and consultant within the Project, as well as providing informal assistance throughout a wide variety of challenges for the Project.

**Nicholas Schnorbus** is currently an undergraduate student studying engineering and physics at RPI. He brings an unmatched enthusiasm to the team, alongside a deep understanding of physical principles and mathematics. His curiosity and passion brings much-needed energy into the Project and will certainly be a driver in the Project's steady growth.

**Jacky Song** is the founder and the leader of the project.
