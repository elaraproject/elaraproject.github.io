# Contribute

We welcome anyone interested, regardless of their educational background/specialization, to join Project Elara! There are no prerequisites or credentials necessary. Please contact any member in the Project to let us know, and then you'll be all set to participate in the Project. You may also send an email to <elaraproject.sci@gmail.com> or (more recommended) <songy14@rpi.edu> with your full name, occupation if you have one (or grade if you're a student), and a short description of your interest in contributing.

However, for full membership in the Project, we ask that prospective members personally pledge to abide by the [Charter](@/charter.md) in oral or written form, and release a public statement confirming their pledge. We feel strongly about our mission and our ideals, and we want all our full members to have the same commitment and dedication.
