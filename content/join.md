# Join Project Elara

Do you want to make the world a better place? Do you want to meet like-minded people? If so, this might be the right place for you.

Project Elara is in need of:

- Web designers and developers to maintain documentation and the website
- Artists and designers to make a design language for the project and create its artwork
- Writers and activists to perform outreach and spread the word about the project
- Aerospace and mechanical engineers to develop launch systems, SSTO vehicles, and future laser-propelled space tugs
- Computer scientists to develop automated spacecraft, self-repair systems, and to work on the Project Elara libraries
- Engineers to develop high-efficiency rectennas, solar mirrors, long-lasting ion engines, and as-yet unexplored propulsion systems
- Biologists to work on genetic engineering of custom high-efficiency photosynthesizing microbial organisms for artificial photosynthesis
- Material scientists to develop coatings for spacecraft, high-reflectance materials, and defensive shielding
- Mathematicians to solve complex orbital mechanics problems, determine optimal orbital placement, and find analytical solutions to various differential equations
- Data scientists to work on neural differential equations solvers, numerical relativity, and numerical optimization
- Theoretical physicists to work on Alcubierre metric optimization, black hole simulation, and geodesic analysis
- Translators to help facilitate international collaboration and to publish all the resources of the project in various languages

If you are of any of these fields, or even are just interested in the project, please send an email to <elaraproject.sci@gmail.com> to join the organization, or alternatively, join the discord at <https://discord.gg/t4Rw2u5d>.
