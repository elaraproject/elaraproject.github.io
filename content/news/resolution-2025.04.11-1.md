_A resolution for ensuring the financial sustainability of the Project and committing ourselves to affordability_

<!-- more -->

**We, the members of Project Elara, adopt the following motion:**

That the goal of the Project, in developing space-based energy and adjacent technologies, will not be for profit, but instead center on **affordability**;

That in order to achieve our goals and sustain the Project, we strive to ensure that our technology is offered at the lowest cost reasonably possible, while keeping in mind the need to financially sustain the Project;

That we will work to maintain sufficient funds and sound stewardship of said funds, to preserve them for the future, and to eventually reach self-sustaining status;

That we hope that the Project's services may eventually be offered for free, in the indefinite future, once it becomes practical to do so;

And that on this day on the 22nd of April, 2025, we hereunto affix our signatures:

Signed,

Jacky Song, Charles Wang, Milo Schnack, Emiliano Vilchis
