This is not a normal article, where I talk about our scientific research and progress we've made as a team. It is something else, that I felt the need to put into words. About what we stand for.

Our work is not unique. There have been many others who have tried - and many who have failed - that came before us. It will not be easy. The odds of us succeeding are realistically very low. There are many hurdles in our way, many rivers we have to cross.

But what defines us is what we strive for. For the hope of a better world to pass on to our future generations, where energy will be plentiful everywhere around the world, and where it will belong to everyone. Our success is not measured by the number of dollars we earn - indeed, it will likely be unprofitable - nor by the number of papers we'll publish, nor the number of citations we get. Our success is measured by how affordable we make our technology, and how many people benefit from it. Our success is measured by how many teams we unite together to work on a common goal, and how fairly we share credit among all of us. Our success is measured by how many scientists and engineers we mentor and launch into successful careers. Our success is measured by the people we choose to continue our mission after us.

Even if there is the tiniest chance we'll succeed, that's a mission worth striving for. And I'm willing to take that chance. Because if we succeed, it would be far more than worth it - and if we don't, we'll have laid the groundwork to help others build on our work. Both are worth having hope - having _[elara](@/about.md)_ - for.
