# Research assets and papers (ARCHIVED)

> **NOTE:** Everything within this folder has been **deprecated** and is no longer up-to-date. It is kept **only** for archival purposes.

Here are the assets and papers for the Project's research, all dedicated to the public domain. The source files are in `source-files/` and are [TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org) files. The release files are in `html/` and `pdf/`. The HTML (web) versions have much better accessibility (although not perfect by any means) just from being HTML and having MathJax integrated. The PDFs are suited for printing and the PDF format simply does not conform well with accessibility best-practices.
