    <p>
      Project Elara (&ldquo;<i>hope</i>&rdquo;) aims to conduct research and
      eventually development of advanced technologies that we envision will
      bring about a better future. Our priority research is in the realm of
      space-based energy harvesting with large-scale solar power swarms.
      Achieving this capability, if done carefully and correctly, would
      provide a stable, lasting energy source orders of magnitude more
      powerful than any contemporary or near-future capabilities. Such a
      system opens the doorway to engineering and construction on a stellar
      scale, including mass interplanetary travel, powering space habitats,
      and even possibly the propulsion of interstellar lightsail arks. More
      importantly, it allows for the possibility of a truly peaceful and
      equitable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of such a system is not solely for the purpose of
      space-based power. Various near-term technologies would also be greatly
      benefitted by the successful development of this technology. To simply
      name a few, the benefits could include improved internet as well as
      greater power equity and accessibility for rural communities and
      developing nations, improved satellite communications, improvements in
      laser surgery, high-precision optics for science experiments such as
      gravitational wave interferometry, and improvements in inertial
      confinement fusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is no doubt that such an undertaking must begin with small
      initial steps and will require countless contributions over generations.
      Thus the present work of the Project is incremental and small-scale,
      with the hope of achieving more with time. We are focused on several key
      technologies that are critical to making space power swarms a
      possibility: high-gain extremely-long-distance microwave transmission,
      persistent space-ground communication, and safe wireless power transfer
      at high power. These are the areas of our immediate computational
      research.
    </p>
    <h2 id="auto-2">2<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Technical description of research<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Our first research milestone is to achieve accurate theoretical and
      computational modelling of long-distance power transmission. Both
      analytical and numerical methods are used for analyzing electromagnetic
      energy transport, and to investigate how high-gain, all-weather
      transmission may be achieved, with specific emphasis on precision
      line-of-sight transmission. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial research has produced a proof-of-concept model that has been
      used in computational electromagnetics simulations. These simulations
      use finite-element methods to obtain numerical solutions to the
      Helmholtz equation \(\nabla^2  \textbf{E} + k^2  \textbf{E} = 0\), and
      finite-difference methods to perform validation testing. While the model
      is proof-of-concept and experimental, it represents a key breakthrough
      and a stepping stone towards a complete, consistent, research-ready
      solver.

      Prospective research consists of the refinement of this model to produce
      an improved model ready for producing publication-quality results. The
      improved model is expected to take into account effects that were
      previously ignored, such as atmospheric attenuation via the ITU-R
      P.676-13 model and transmission from a moving orbital
      platform via numerical integration with a hybrid GOCE6-GGM03-EGM2008
      model. Furthermore, unlike the proof-of-concept model, the improved
      model will be a multiphysics model that integrates more (eventually, all) aspects of the
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      More computational simulations will allow fine-tuning the design of the
      concept space swarm and in turn be used to make more accurate
      simulations of the system. This iterative process is expected to
      continue for a significant portion of time, until sufficient
      computational testing has yielded a highly-detailed design that can be
      built into functional prototypes. Artificial vacuum testing and
      atmospheric testing is then expected to progress, with a further
      test-design-simulation cycle to continue adding refinements. This
      process is expected to continue until design finalization.

    style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      Given its ambitious aims, the Project is not meant to be a short-term
      project, but one that will span across generations. The longevity of the
      Project is safeguarded by its open-source nature. All published
      documentation of the Project is freely available online, and eventually,
      is projected to be made available, again at no cost, in book form. The
      loss of the project organization or of its team would not constitute the
      end of the Project. The project is deliberately designed such that it
      can be picked up and continued at any point from its encyclopedic
      handbook, as well as further books that contain fully-commented source
      code, design specifications, and blueprints. As mentioned, all of its
      books and documentation are fully dedicated to the public domain.
